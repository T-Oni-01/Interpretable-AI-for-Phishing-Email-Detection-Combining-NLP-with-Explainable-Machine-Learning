# nterpretable-AI-for-Phishing-Email-Detection-Combining-NLP-with-Explainable-Machine-Learning
This is a direct Independent Study looking into the use of explainable AI (XAI) in Phishing Detection. By combining algorithms that explain machine learning models prediction (LIME &amp; ELI5), with models such as Random Forest &amp; XGBoost, users are provided a deeper understanding behind the reasoning of phishing detection in emails.

# Using an interactive GUI created using Pycharm and it's libraries, a fully interactive system is built with the following capabilities

  - Model Selection and Training (Random Forest or XGBoost)
  - Storage of trained model for future use
  - Phishing Email Predictor
  - Explanation/Reasoning behind prediction
